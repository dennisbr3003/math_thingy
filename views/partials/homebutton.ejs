<!-- 
    if you want to use this partial you must have a translation for 'hometext'.
    Translation key 'hometext' is always resolved for each page wether it exists or 
    not. You need to create a section in each translation file with the name of the 
    page and a key 'hometext'. Her is an example for the 'about' page:

    "about": {
        "checkout": "...some translation...",
        "config": "...some translation...",
        "about": "...some translation...",
        "hometext": "I've seen enough, I'm off! ðŸ˜’"
    }

    You can use use emoji's in these texts
